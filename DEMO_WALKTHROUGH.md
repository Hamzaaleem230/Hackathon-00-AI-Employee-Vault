## 🎙️ Phase 1: The Opening Pitch (Intro Script)
**Speaker Script:**
"Good morning/afternoon, Judges. We are here to present **AI Employee Vault**—an intelligent document approval and automation platform. In today’s fast-paced corporate environment, manual document verification is a bottleneck. Our system eliminates this by acting as an automated 'Digital Employee' that watches, analyzes, and decides on documents in real-time. Let’s see it in action."

---

## ⚙️ Phase 2: System Startup & Infrastructure
**Action:** Open the terminal/console and the dashboard side-by-side.

* **Initialize the Environment:** Show the command to launch the application.
* **Activating the Watcher:** Point out the "Watcher Service" logs. 
* **Judges Insight:** Explain that the system is now in "Listening Mode," monitoring specific directories or cloud storage buckets for incoming files without needing human triggers.

---

## 📂 Phase 3: The File Drop (Live Action)
**Action:** Drag and drop a sample document (e.g., an invoice or a contract) into the monitored folder.

* **The Reaction:** Show the console/logs detecting the new file within milliseconds.
* **Narrative:** "Notice how the system instantly picks up the file. There is no manual 'upload' button required; the **AI Employee Vault** is integrated directly into the workflow, simulating a real employee monitoring their inbox or shared drive."

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: The AI Decision Engine
**Action:** Switch to the "Processing" view or log output to show the AI's thought process.

* **Analysis:** Explain that the AI is extracting key entities (dates, amounts, terms).
* **The Verdict:** Show the **Approval** or **Rejection** status.
* **Confidence Scores:** Highlight the AI's confidence level (e.g., *98% Confidence*).
* **Narrative:** "The AI Decision Engine doesn't just read text; it understands context. Based on our pre-defined business logic, it has autonomously decided to approve this file because it meets all compliance criteria. If the confidence score falls below a certain threshold, it flags it for human review, ensuring 100% accuracy."

---

## 📊 Phase 5: Dashboard & Audit Trail
**Action:** Open the Web Dashboard UI.

* **Live Updates:** Show the document appearing at the top of the "Processed" list.
* **History View:** Scroll through previous entries to show consistency.
* **Cloud Sync:** Briefly mention that all metadata and decisions are synced to the **Cloud Database** for permanent record-keeping.
* **Audit Trail:** Click on a specific entry to show the "Why" behind the decision (Transparency).

## 🏁 Phase 6: The Closing Statement
**Speaker Script:**
"To conclude, **AI Employee Vault** isn't just a storage tool; it’s a decision-making engine. We have successfully combined **Folder Automation**, **AI Reasoning**, and **Cloud Synchronization** into a single, seamless pipeline. By deploying this, companies can reduce processing time by up to 90%, allowing their human employees to focus on high-value tasks while the Vault handles the paperwork. Thank you for your time. We are now open for questions."

### 💡 Demo Tips for the Team:
* **Prepare two files:** One that clearly meets criteria (for instant approval) and one that is missing information (to show a graceful rejection).
* **Keep it snappy:** The transition from 'File Drop' to 'AI Decision' should be the "Wow" moment—don't let it lag!
